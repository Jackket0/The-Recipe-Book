## Technical Implementation

### Search System
**Enhanced Search (`lib/search.ts`)**:
1. Fuzzy search with Fuse.js (configurable threshold)
2. Multi-field weighted search (title 40%, description 30%, ingredients 20%, tags 10%)
3. Ingredient-based suggestions and autocomplete
4. Related recipe recommendations by common ingredients
5. Advanced multi-criteria filtering
6. Proper TypeScript types for Fuse.js integration

**Legacy Search (`lib/recipes.ts`)**: Basic text matching for backward compatibility

### Favorites System (`lib/favorites.ts`)
- localStorage-based persistence
- Type-safe favorite management
- Real-time updates across components
- Custom events for component synchronization
- Export/import functionality
- Comprehensive error handling

### Recipe Scaling (`lib/scaling.ts`)
- Dynamic ingredient quantity calculations
- Fraction and decimal conversion
- Cooking time adjustments
- Validation with warnings
- Type-safe scaling operations

### Route Structure
- `/` - Homepage with featured recipes
- `/recipes` - All recipes grid
- `/recipes/[slug]` - Individual recipe pages  
- `/recipes/category/[category]` - Recipes by main category
- `/recipes/cuisine/[cuisine]` - Recipes by cuisine tag
- `/recipes/dietary/[dietary]` - Recipes by dietary tag
- `/categories` - Category overview page
- `/favorites` - User's favorite recipes (client-side filtered)

### Performance Optimizations
- Static site generation (SSG) with revalidation
- Image optimization via Next.js Image component

- Union types for categories/tags with exhaustive checking
- JSON Schema validation with AJV
- Runtime validation with comprehensive error reporting
- Type guards for null checking
- Validation warnings for content quality
- All components have typed props interfaces
- All utility functions have explicit return types

### Component Architecture  
- Functional components with hooks
- Props interfaces for all components with optional vs required props
- Reusable UI components (RecipeCard, CategoryBadge, FavoriteButton, etc.)
- Interactive components (RecipeScaler, PrintButton)
- Layout component with SEO metadata
- Client-side hydration handling for localStorage features
- Event-driven updates for favorites system

### Data Processing

- Ingredient parsing and quantity extraction
- Sorted results (newest first, then alphabetical)
- Type-safe data transformations

## Current Limitations & Opportunities

### Content Management
- **Current**: Manual markdown file editing with JSON Schema validation
- **Opportunity**: Admin interface, bulk import, real-time validation UI

### Data Storage  
- **Current**: File system with in-memory processing + localStorage for favorites
- **Opportunity**: Database integration (SQLite + Prisma mentioned in user memory)

### User Features
- **Current**: Static content with localStorage favorites, recipe scaling, and print functionality
- **Opportunity**: User accounts, cloud sync, ratings, submissions, meal planning

### Search & Discovery
- **Current**: Fuzzy search, ingredient suggestions, related recipes, advanced filtering
- **Opportunity**: ML-based recommendations, nutritional search, seasonal suggestions

### Content Structure
- **Current**: Structured markdown with JSON Schema validation, recipe scaling, and favorites
- **Opportunity**: Nutritional data integration, cooking timers, step-by-step mode

## Recommended Next Steps

3. **Advanced Features**: Nutritional info, meal planning, shopping lists

### Long-term Vision
1. **User-Generated Content**: Recipe submissions, reviews, ratings
2. **AI Integration**: Recipe recommendations, ingredient substitutions
3. **External Integrations**: Grocery APIs, meal planning services

## Code Quality
