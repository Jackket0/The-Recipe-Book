These classic chocolate chip cookies are the perfect balance of crispy edges and chewy centers. The secret is to slightly underbake them and let them finish cooking on the hot pan.

## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- **Room temperature ingredients**: Make sure your eggs and butter are at room temperature for better mixing
- **Don't overbake**: The cookies should look slightly underbaked when you remove them from the oven
- **Chill the dough**: For thicker cookies, chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking
- **Use good chocolate**: High-quality chocolate chips make a noticeable difference in taste

## Variations

- **Double Chocolate**: Add ¼ cup cocoa powder to the flour mixture
- **Oatmeal Chocolate Chip**: Replace 1 cup flour with 1 cup old-fashioned oats
- **Sea Salt**: Sprinkle a pinch of flaky sea salt on top before baking
