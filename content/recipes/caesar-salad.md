This classic Caesar salad features a rich, creamy homemade dressing that's so much better than store-bought. The key is using fresh, quality ingredients and making sure your lettuce is completely dry.

## Dressing Tips

- **Emulsify properly**: Add oil slowly while whisking to prevent breaking
- **Room temperature egg**: Use a room temperature egg yolk for better emulsification
- **Fresh lemon juice**: Always use fresh lemon juice, not bottled
- **Taste and adjust**: Balance the flavors to your preference

## Ingredient Notes

- **Anchovies**: Traditional but optional - they add umami depth
- **Egg yolk**: Use pasteurized eggs if concerned about raw eggs
- **Parmesan**: Use freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano for best flavor
- **Romaine**: Hearts of romaine work best for crisp texture

## Variations

- **Chicken Caesar**: Add grilled chicken breast slices
- **Shrimp Caesar**: Top with grilled or sautéed shrimp
- **Kale Caesar**: Substitute massaged kale for romaine
- **Vegan**: Use vegan mayo base and nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan

## Make-Ahead Tips

- Dressing can be made 2 days ahead and refrigerated
- Wash and chop lettuce up to 1 day ahead, store in refrigerator
- Add dressing and toppings just before serving to prevent wilting

## Serving Suggestions

- Perfect alongside grilled steak or chicken
- Great as a light lunch with crusty bread
- Serve as an appetizer before Italian meals
- Add protein to make it a complete meal
