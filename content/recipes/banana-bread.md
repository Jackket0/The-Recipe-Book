This banana bread is incredibly moist and flavorful, making it perfect for breakfast, snacking, or even dessert. The secret is using very ripe bananas and not overmixing the batter.

## Tips for Success

- **Use very ripe bananas**: The more spots and the softer they are, the better! They should be easy to mash with a fork
- **Don't overmix**: Mix just until the flour disappears to keep the bread tender
- **Check for doneness**: A toothpick should come out with just a few moist crumbs, not wet batter
- **Cool completely**: Let it cool before slicing for the best texture

## Variations

- **Chocolate Chip**: Add ½ cup mini chocolate chips
- **Walnut**: Fold in ½ cup chopped walnuts
- **Cinnamon Swirl**: Mix 2 tbsp sugar with 1 tsp cinnamon, swirl into batter
- **Healthier Version**: Substitute half the flour with whole wheat flour and reduce sugar

## Storage

- Room temperature: 3-4 days wrapped in plastic wrap
- Refrigerator: Up to 1 week
- Freezer: Up to 3 months (wrap tightly in plastic wrap and foil)
