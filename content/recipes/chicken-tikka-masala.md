This Chicken Tikka Masala is a restaurant-quality dish that's surprisingly easy to make at home. The combination of spices creates a rich, aromatic sauce that perfectly complements the tender chicken.

## Tips for Success

- **Marinate the chicken**: This step is crucial for flavor and tenderness
- **Don't rush the onions**: Cook them until they're properly softened
- **Adjust spice level**: Add more or less tikka masala paste to your taste
- **Use full-fat yogurt**: It provides better flavor and texture

## Variations

- **Vegetarian**: Replace chicken with paneer or chickpeas
- **Spicier version**: Add chopped green chilies
- **Creamier**: Add more heavy cream or coconut milk
- **Grilled chicken**: Grill the marinated chicken before adding to sauce

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve with basmati rice and naan bread
- Add a side of cucumber raita
- Include pickled onions for extra flavor
- Pair with a crisp green salad
