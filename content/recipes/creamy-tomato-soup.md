This homemade tomato soup is so much better than anything from a can! It's rich, creamy, and packed with flavor from fresh herbs and quality ingredients. Perfect paired with a grilled cheese sandwich for the ultimate comfort meal.

## Ingredient Tips

- **Quality tomatoes**: Use good quality canned tomatoes - San Marzano are excellent
- **Fresh herbs**: Fresh basil makes a huge difference in flavor
- **Cream alternatives**: Half-and-half or whole milk can substitute for heavy cream
- **Broth choice**: Vegetable broth keeps it vegetarian, chicken broth adds richness

## Texture Options

- **Smooth**: Blend completely for silky smooth texture
- **Chunky**: Blend partially or not at all for rustic texture
- **Extra smooth**: Strain through fine mesh sieve after blending

## Flavor Variations

- **Roasted**: Roast fresh tomatoes before adding for deeper flavor
- **Spicy**: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes with the herbs
- **Smoky**: Add a dash of smoked paprika
- **Herb-forward**: Add fresh thyme, rosemary, or parsley

## Make-Ahead and Storage

- Can be made 3 days ahead and refrigerated
- Freezes well for up to 3 months (before adding cream)
- Add cream when reheating, not before freezing
- Reheat gently to prevent cream from curdling

## Serving Suggestions

- Classic grilled cheese sandwich
- Crusty sourdough bread with butter
- Parmesan cheese croutons
- A dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt
- Drizzle of good olive oil and fresh herbs
