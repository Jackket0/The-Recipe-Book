This test recipe demonstrates the fraction normalization feature by including various fraction formats:

## Fraction Types Included:

1. **Unicode fractions**: ½, ⅓, ¾
2. **Mixed numbers**: 1 1/2, 2 3/4, 1 1/3, 1 1/4
3. **Common fractions**: 1/4, 1/8, 2/3

## Expected Normalization:

When this recipe is processed by the fraction normalization system:
- "1½ cups" → "1.5 cups"
- "⅓ cup" → "0.333 cup"
- "¾ cup" → "0.75 cup"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons" → "1.5 teaspoons"
- "2 3/4 cups" → "2.75 cups"
- "1/4 cup" → "0.25 cup"
- "1/8 teaspoon" → "0.125 teaspoon"
- "1 1/3 cups" → "1.333 cups"
- "2/3 cup" → "0.667 cup"
- "1 1/4 teaspoons" → "1.25 teaspoons"

## Scaling Test:

When scaled to 16 servings (2x), the quantities should be:
- "1.5 cups" → "3 cups"
- "0.333 cup" → "0.667 cup"
- "0.75 cup" → "1.5 cups"
- "1.5 teaspoons" → "3 teaspoons"
- "2.75 cups" → "5.5 cups"
- "0.25 cup" → "0.5 cup"
- "0.125 teaspoon" → "0.25 teaspoon"
- "1.333 cups" → "2.667 cups"
- "0.667 cup" → "1.333 cups"
- "1.25 teaspoons" → "2.5 teaspoons"

This recipe serves as a comprehensive test case for the fraction normalization feature.
