These pancakes are incredibly light and fluffy thanks to the perfect ratio of ingredients and the important step of not overmixing the batter. They're sure to become your go-to weekend breakfast!

## Secrets to Fluffy Pancakes

- **Don't overmix**: Lumpy batter is your friend - overmixing develops gluten and makes tough pancakes
- **Let it rest**: Allowing the batter to sit for 5 minutes helps the flour hydrate
- **Right temperature**: Medium heat prevents burning while ensuring they cook through
- **Fresh baking powder**: Make sure your baking powder is fresh for maximum lift

## Flavor Variations

- **Blueberry**: Fold in ¾ cup fresh or frozen blueberries
- **Chocolate Chip**: Add ½ cup mini chocolate chips to the batter
- **Banana**: Mash 1 ripe banana and fold into the batter
- **Lemon**: Add 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tablespoon lemon zest

## Make-Ahead Tips

- **Batter**: Can be made the night before and stored in the refrigerator
- **Cooked pancakes**: Freeze between parchment paper, reheat in toaster
- **Dry mix**: Pre-mix dry ingredients and store in an airtight container

## Serving Ideas

- Classic maple syrup and butter
- Fresh berry compote
- Whipped cream and strawberries
- Peanut butter and sliced bananas
