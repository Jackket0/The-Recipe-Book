These lemon bars are the perfect combination of buttery shortbread crust and bright, tangy lemon filling. They're a crowd-pleasing dessert that's elegant enough for special occasions but simple enough for everyday treats.

## Success Tips

- **Use fresh lemons**: Fresh lemon juice and zest make all the difference in flavor
- **Don't overbake**: The filling should be just set, not browned
- **Cool completely**: Let them cool and chill before cutting for clean slices
- **Sharp knife**: Use a sharp knife and wipe between cuts for neat squares

## Crust Variations

- **Graham cracker**: Substitute 1½ cups graham cracker crumbs for flour in crust
- **Almond**: Add ¼ cup ground almonds to the crust mixture
- **Coconut**: Add ¼ cup shredded coconut to the crust

## Filling Variations

- **Lime bars**: Substitute lime juice and zest for lemon
- **Meyer lemon**: Use Meyer lemons for a sweeter, more floral flavor
- **Extra tangy**: Add an extra tablespoon of lemon juice

## Storage and Serving

- Store covered in refrigerator for up to 5 days
- Can be frozen for up to 3 months
- Dust with powdered sugar just before serving
- Cut into small squares - they're rich!

## Troubleshooting

- **Soggy crust**: Make sure to bake the crust until golden before adding filling
- **Filling too runny**: Make sure eggs are well beaten and flour is fully incorporated
- **Messy cuts**: Chill completely and use a sharp, clean knife
